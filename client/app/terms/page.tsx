        <h2>9. No Solicitation Policy</h2>
        <p>
          a. Hello_Miami maintains a strict policy against solicitation among
          its members. Users are prohibited from engaging in any form of
          solicitation, including but not limited to promoting products,
          services, events, or other commercial activities to fellow members. b.
          If a user is found to have engaged in solicitation within the
          Hello_Miami community, they will be held liable to provide Hello_Miami
          with all proceeds generated from such solicitation that occurred as a
          result of their actions on the platform. c. Hello_Miami reserves the
          right to take appropriate action, including but not limited to
          suspension or termination of the user&apos;s account, in the event of
          a violation of this solicitation policy. By accessing or using
          Hello_Miami, you acknowledge and agree to abide by the No Solicitation
          Policy outlined in these Terms. Violation of this policy may result in
          disciplinary action, including the forfeiture of proceeds generated
          from solicitation activities.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Hello_Miami, its
          affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents,
          licensors, and suppliers from and against all claims, losses,
          expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys&apos;
          fees, resulting from any violation of these Terms or any activity
          related to your account (including negligent or wrongful conduct) by
          you or any other person accessing Hello_Miami using your account.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          In no event shall Hello_Miami or its suppliers be liable for any
          damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or
          profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or
          inability to use Hello_Miami, even if Hello_Miami or a Hello_Miami
          authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of
          the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not
          allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability
          for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not
          apply to you.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and
          Hello_Miami regarding your use of Hello_Miami, superseding any prior
          agreements between you and Hello_Miami (including, but not limited to,
          any prior versions of the Terms).
        </p>

        <h2>13. Severability</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or
          invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum
          extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full
          force and effect and enforceable.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Waiver</h2>
        <p>
          The failure of Hello_Miami to enforce any right or provision of these
          Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Assignment</h2>
        <p>
          Hello_Miami may assign or delegate these Terms and/or its rights or
          obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any person or
